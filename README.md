# Headline

Headline is a [Ghost](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost) theme built from the ground up for local news. 

While it can be used for any purpose, the theme takes a thoughtful approach to displaying large amounts of content across various areas of coverage.

Headline adapts the content by allowing to choose which topics are front and center.

**Demo: https://headline.ghost.io**

# Criptonaut update

We update the theme for make it more modern and we adapt it for our CSS style :)

# Development

Edition styles are compiled using Gulp/PostCSS to polyfill future CSS spec.

You'll need installed globally:

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com) 
- 
- After that, from the theme's root directory:

```bash
# Install
yarn

# Run build & watch for changes
yarn dev
```

Then you could edit `/assets/css/` files, which will be compiled to `/assets/built/` automatically :)

You can make a PR if you fix issues or suggest UI/UX improvements and we can update our main branch (forked from Ghost one)
